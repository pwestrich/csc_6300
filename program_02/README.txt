You should be able to copy the contents of html/ into any folder underneath your web root this time; I think all my paths are relative.

I'm using the default credentials, ports, and paths for the XML database servers. IF you've changed them, you'll need to do so in my scripts as well.

I was not able to get POST working for exist, so be careful on the number of characters you feed in to the text boxes.
