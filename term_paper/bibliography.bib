abstract = {As their prices decline, their storage capacities increase, and their endurance improves, NAND Flash Solid State Disks (SSD) provide an increasingly attractive alternative to Hard Disk Drives (HDD) for portable computing systems and PCs. This paper presents a study of NAND Flash SSD architectures and their management techniques, quantifying SSD performance under user-driven/PC applications in a multi-tasked environment; user activity represents typical PC workloads and includes browsing files and folders, emailing, text editing and document creation, surfing the web, listening to music and playing movies, editing large pictures, and running office applications. We find the following: (a) the real limitation to NAND Flash memory performance is not its low per-device bandwidth but its internal core interface; (b) NAND Flash memory media transfer rates do not need to scale up to those of HDDs for good performance; (c) SSD organizations that exploit concurrency at both the system and device level (e.g. RAID-like organizations and Micron-style (superblocks) improve performance significantly; and (d) these system- and device-level concurrency mechanisms are, to a significant degree, orthogonal: that is, the performance increase due to one does not come at the expense of the other, as each exploits a different facet of concurrency exhibited within the PC workload.},

abstract = {The past few decades have witnessed a chronic and widening imbalance among processor bandwidth, disk capacity, and access speed of disk. According to Amdhal's law, the performance enhancement possible with a given improvement is limited by the amount that the improved feature is used. This implies that the performance enhancement of an OLTP system would be seriously limited without a considerable improvement in I/O throughput. Since the market debut of flash memory SSD a few years ago, we have made a continued effort to overcome its poor random write performance and to provide stable and sufficient I/O bandwidth. In this paper, we present three different flash memory SSD models prototyped recently by Samsung Electronics. We then show how the flash memory SSD technology has advanced to reverse the widening trend of performance gap between processors and storage devices. We also demonstrate that even a single flash memory drive can outperform a level-0 RAID with eight enterprise class 15k-RPM disk drives with respect to transaction throughput, cost effectiveness and energy consumption.},

@article{Lee2008,
abstract = {Due to its superiority such as low access latency, low energy consumption, light weight, and shock resistance, the success of flash memory as a storage alternative for mobile computing devices has been steadily expanded into personal computer and enterprise server markets with ever increasing capacity of its storage. However, since flash memory exhibits poor performance for small-to-moderate sized writes requested in a random order, existing database systems may not be able to take full advantage of flash memory without elaborate flash-aware data structures and algorithms. The objective of this work is to understand the applicability and potential impact that flash memory SSD (Solid State Drive) has for certain type of storage spaces of a database server where sequential writes and random reads are prevalent. We show empirically that up to more than an order of magnitude improvement can be achieved in transaction processing by replacing magnetic disk with flash memory SSD for transaction log, rollback segments, and temporary table spaces.},

abstract = {High-end solid state disks (SSDs) provide much faster ac- cess to data compared to conventional hard disk drives. We present a technique for using solid-state storage as a caching layer between RAMand hard disks in databasemanagement systems. By caching data that is accessed frequently, disk I/O is reduced. For random I/O, the potential performance gains are particularly significant. Our system continuously monitors the disk access patterns to identify hot regions of the disk. Temperature statistics are maintained at the granularity of an extent, i.e., 32 pages, and are kept current through an aging mechanism. Unlike prior cachingmethods, once the SSD is populated with pages from warm regions cold pages are not admitted into the cache, leading to low levels of cache pollution. Simulations based on DB2 I/O traces, and a prototype implementation within DB2 both show substantial performance improvements.},
